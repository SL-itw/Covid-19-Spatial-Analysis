<p>NOTE:  "Families" consist of a householder and one or more other people related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption.  They do not include same-sex married couples even if the marriage was performed in a state issuing marriage certificates for same-sex couples.  Same-sex couples are included in the families category if there is at least one additional person related to the householder by birth or adoption.  Responses of "same-sex spouse" were edited during processing to "unmarried partner."</p>
